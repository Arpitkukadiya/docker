  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker and how does it differ from virtual machines?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies in containers. Unlike VMs, Docker containers share the host OS kernel and are lightweight and faster.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An image is a read-only template used to create containers. A container is a running instance of an image.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>3Ô∏è‚É£ How do you share data between containers?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Using Docker volumes or bind mounts, containers can share persistent storage and communicate through it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>4Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker Compose?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker Compose is a tool to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>5Ô∏è‚É£ Explain Docker Swarm and how it works.</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker Swarm is a native clustering tool for Docker. It turns multiple Docker hosts into a single virtual host and allows deploying services across nodes with built-in load balancing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the use of the <code>Dockerfile</code>?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Dockerfile is a script with a set of instructions to build a Docker image automatically.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>7Ô∏è‚É£ How do you monitor containers in production?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, or Docker stats and logs to monitor container health and performance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>8Ô∏è‚É£ What are some best practices when working with Docker?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Keep images small, use multi-stage builds, clean up unused containers/images, use `.dockerignore`, tag images clearly, and scan images for vulnerabilities.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Dockerfile?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>CMD</code> sets default arguments for the container‚Äôs main process, while <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> defines the executable. Together, they allow flexible container configuration.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>üîü How do you ensure security in Docker?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use minimal base images, apply image scanning, run containers as non-root users, use Docker Bench for security, and regularly update images.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What is multi-stage build in Docker?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A multi-stage build allows using multiple FROM statements in a Dockerfile to create smaller, production-ready images by copying only required artifacts from a build stage.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ How does networking work in Docker?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker creates a bridge network by default. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate via container name. You can also use overlay networks in swarm mode.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between COPY and ADD in Dockerfile?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>COPY</code> simply copies files and directories. <code>ADD</code> does the same but also supports remote URLs and automatically unpacks compressed files.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ How can you persist data generated by and used by Docker containers?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use Docker volumes or bind mounts to persist data. Volumes are managed by Docker and are the preferred mechanism for persistent data.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question-box">
    <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ What are some common Docker commands used in day-to-day work?</h5>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>docker ps</code>, <code>docker run</code>, <code>docker exec</code>, <code>docker logs</code>, <code>docker-compose up/down</code>, <code>docker build</code>, <code>docker images</code>, and <code>docker network ls</code>.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Keep the same <head> and <style> as in your original -->
<!-- Add the following new questions inside <body>, after the existing .question-box blocks -->

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker and why is it used?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker is a containerization platform used to package applications and their dependencies together in isolated containers. It ensures consistent environments from development to production and improves deployment speed and scalability.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker containers share the host OS kernel and are lightweight, starting instantly. VMs emulate entire OS environments including hardware, making them heavier and slower to boot.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ Explain Docker architecture.</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker architecture includes the Docker Client (CLI), Docker Daemon (Server), Docker Images, Docker Containers, and Docker Registries (like DockerHub). The client communicates with the daemon to build, run, and manage containers.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the role of Docker Daemon?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Docker Daemon (`dockerd`) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between image and container?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An image is a static blueprint or template. A container is a live, running instance of that image with a writable layer.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ How to create and run a container?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use <code>docker run image_name</code> to create and run a container. For example: <code>docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx</code></p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Dockerfile?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Dockerfile is a text file with a set of instructions to build a Docker image, such as <code>FROM</code>, <code>COPY</code>, <code>RUN</code>, and <code>CMD</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What are common instructions in a Dockerfile?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Common instructions include <code>FROM</code> (base image), <code>COPY</code>, <code>ADD</code>, <code>RUN</code>, <code>CMD</code>, <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, <code>EXPOSE</code>, and <code>WORKDIR</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ What are volumes in Docker?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Volumes are storage mechanisms used to persist data generated and used by containers. They are managed by Docker and remain even after a container is deleted.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between bind mount and named volume?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bind mounts map a specific host path to a container path. Named volumes are managed by Docker and stored in Docker‚Äôs internal volume directory. Named volumes are preferred for portability and ease of use.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the use of Docker networks?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker networks enable communication between containers. Containers in the same network can connect using container names. Custom networks provide isolation and DNS-based discovery.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ How to connect multiple containers?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Create a custom bridge network with <code>docker network create</code> and run containers with <code>--network</code> flag. This allows them to communicate by name.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker Compose?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Docker Compose is a tool to define and run multi-container applications using a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, making orchestration easy.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ How does docker-compose differ from docker run?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>docker run</code> is for single containers. <code>docker-compose</code> allows managing multiple services as a group using a YAML file, making multi-container setups easier.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
  <h5>3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ How do you publish Docker images?</h5>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Tag the image and push to a registry:<br>
  <code>docker tag myapp username/myapp</code><br>
